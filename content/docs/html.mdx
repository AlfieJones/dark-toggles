  "Framework agnostic guide to adding Theme Toggles to your site";

# HTML

The most basic and flexible way to add Theme Toggles to your site. This guide will walk you through the process of adding a Theme Toggle to your site regardless of your framework. All our framework integrations are built on top of this method.

<Note>
  If you're using a framework that has built-in support for Theme Toggles, it's
  recommended that you use that instead.

## Installation

It's recommend that you use a package manager to install Theme Toggles. This will make it easier to update to the latest version.

### npm registry

<CodeGroup title="Install"  >

    ```bash {{ language: 'console', title: 'npm' }}
    npm install @theme-toggles/core
    ```

    ```bash {{ language: 'console', title: 'yarn' }}
    yarn add @theme-toggles/core
    ```

    ```bash {{ language: 'console', title: 'pnpm' }}
    pnpm install @theme-toggles/core
    ```

</CodeGroup>

### CDN

To keep your bundle size small, we export each Theme Toggle as a separate package. You can use a CDN to include the Theme Toggle you want to use.
Replace `{{toggle name}}` with the name of the Theme Toggle you want to use and `{{variant}}` with the variant you want to use. The available variants are found in the [Variants](#variants) section.

<CodeGroup title="CDN"  >
