## About
Our project provides you with a quick and effortless way to implement well designed toggles. With more websites supporting both light and dark themes, it's important to ensure sites also have a clean and accessible toggle.

We use SVG’s for each of our toggles, animating them with CSS. Using SVG’s instead of html elements like div’s enables us to have minimal markup whilst maintaining a high quality and scalable icon.
