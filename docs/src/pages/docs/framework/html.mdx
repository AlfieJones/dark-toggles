# HTML framework guide

The most basic and flexible way to add Theme Toggles to your site. This guide will walk you through the process of adding a Theme Toggle to your site regardless of your framework. All our framework integrations are built on top of this package.

## Getting started

### Installing

#### CDN

> Ensure to replace "\{toggle type}" and "\{toggle name}" with the type and name of the toggle you want to use.
> It's recommended to use the button type of toggle as it's the most accessible.

<br />

<DynamicCode replacements={{
    "{pkg.version}": pkg.version
}}>

```html /{toggle type}/ /{toggle name}/
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/theme-toggles@{pkg.version}/dist/{toggle type}/{toggle name}.min.css"
/>
```

</DynamicCode>

See the full list of css from the [CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/theme-toggles?path=css) page.

#### Node modules

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```bash 
  pnpm add @theme-toggles/core 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash 
  npm install @theme-toggles/core 
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
   yarn add @theme-toggles/core
   ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding the toggle

The easiest way to add the toggle to a page is to copy the code from the [toggles page](/toggles) page and paste it into your page.

```html
/* Example for the dark-side toggle */
<button class="theme-toggle" type="button" aria-label="Toggle theme">
  <svg
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    width="1em"
    height="1em"
    class="theme-toggle__dark-side"
    fill="currentColor"
    viewBox="0 0 512 512"
  >
    <path
      d="M256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512 256 256 0 0 0 0-512Zm0 464V48a208 208 0 0 1 0 416Z"
    />
  </svg>
</button>
```

### Toggeling

If you're using the button or div toggle types, simply add .dark to any parent element.


- `theme-toggle--light` - Light theme
- `theme-toggle--dark` - Dark theme

If you're using the checkbox toggle type, you don't need to add any classes to the body.

## Config

### Animation duration

The animation duration is set to `500ms` by default. You can change this by setting the `--theme-toggle__{toggle name}--duration` variable.

```css
/* Example for the around toggle */
:root {
  --theme-toggle__around--duration: 500ms;
}
```

### Toggle types

We have 3 types of toggles available:

#### Button (recommended)

This is the most accessible toggle type. It's recommended to use this type of toggle.

To improve accessibility, we recommend adding the following attributes to the button:

- `aria-label="Toggle theme"`
- `aria-pressed="\{false/true}"`
- `title="Switch to \{dark/light} theme"`

#### Checkbox

Unlike the button type, the checkbox manages it's own state. This means you don't need to add any toggled classes to the body or toggle (You still need to handle the theme change yourself).

To improve accessibility, we recommend adding the following attributes to the checkbox:

- `title`="Switch to \{dark/light} theme"
- `<span class="theme-toggle-sr">Toggle theme</span>` (This is a hidden element inside the label that will be read by screen readers)

#### Div

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
  The div type is not accessible and should only be used if you're implementing
  your own toggle.
</Callout>

An example use case would be the dropdown for changing the theme of these docs
